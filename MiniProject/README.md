# Kmeans Algorithm
Kmeans algorithm in pure python code

## Clustering Algorithm for 3D Pionts
Based on Manhatan distance or Euclidean distance you can cluster 3D points 

## How To Use This
You just need run this code and interact with the program via CMD
Firts it asks how many clusters do you wish to have and then you need to specify the distance algorithm
That's It. Here Is Your Clusters and Centers
it's just That Simple
